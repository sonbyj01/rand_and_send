# Rand[om] and Send 
Script written for Yale CCM Daily Prayer Requests

The script will (*soon) randomly pick an email from a list and send a Google Form link to that email. 
The objective is to maintain secrecy on who fills out the Google Form. A cron tab script will be created
soon so it will send at the same time daily. I will also add an error checking mechanism just in case
the email fails the first time. 

- [x] send an email
- [x] randomly pick an email from list (waiting for the list...)
- [x] error checking just in case failed to connect to socket 
- [ ] crontab script

I'll make a more comprehensive README.md when I'm done and I feel like it...
